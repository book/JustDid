* edit entries
  * dialog to set time, chorename (and later: who-did-it)
  * chorename, who-did-it can include drop-down of pre-existing
* move input of new chore behind plus button
  * same dialog as edit, different defaults
* view the log of specific type of chore (filter?/search?)
  * chore specific config?
* share a JustDone list with another user
  * who-did-it

-----
* modify files and see them reflected in the device,
	the files can be "uploaded" via the IDE find out the process from the CLI
* write a Makefile to build the .apk from the command line
* when adding a new entry, scroll back to the top to see it

New UI:
* action bar at the bottom:
  * new entry button    -> opens an edit box
  * repeat entry button -> opens sorted list of buttons to add an known chore
  * edit button         -> each chore entry become editable (label, date, delete)


Done:
✓ make it easier to repeat things (when did I last empty the cat litter?)
  ✓ show the top 3 chores as direct-entry buttons
✓ dynamically update the text and action from the EntryList
✓ save in a new format: version, epoch, chore-name
✓ save the entire EntryList
✓ read the file on startup
✓ show old entries in a nice way
  ✓ newest on top
  ✓ format the date
✓ make <Enter> act as the button (and no newlines in the text)
✓ scroll the taskLog when it's bigger than the screen
