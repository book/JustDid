* edit entries
✓ make it easier to repeat things (when did I last empty the cat litter?)
  * show the top 9 chores as direct-entry buttons (3x3)
    * make a button list of known chores
      * static set of buttons in the rigid layout
      ✓ dynamically update the text and action from the EntryList
    * programmatically add buttons to UI? (more buttons if they fit)
* move input of new chore behind plus button
* two panes/views: one for entry (and last 3 items?), one for the full log
  * the log itself could have a "+" for "oh, I forgot to record doing that"
* view the log of specific type of chore
  * chore specific config?
* share a TODO list with another user

* modify files and see them reflected in the device,
	the files can be "uploaded" via the IDE find out the process from the CLI
* write a Makefile to build the .apk from the command line

New UI:
* action bar at the bottom:
  * new entry button    -> opens an edit box
  * repeat entry button -> opens sorted list of buttons to add an known chore
  * edit button         -> each chore entry become editable (label, date, delete)


Done:
✓ save in a new format: version, epoch, chore-name
✓ save the entire EntryList
✓ read the file on startup
✓ show old entries in a nice way
  ✓ newest on top
  ✓ format the date
✓ make <Enter> act as the button (and no newlines in the text)
✓ scroll the taskLog when it's bigger than the screen
